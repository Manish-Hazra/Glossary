Our world was never peaceful. It is sad but true and there is no chance our generation will witness a peaceful Earth. It is possible to have a long peace, the condition our society is experiencing at the moment. It means there are no massive conflicts for a long period of time. But everything can change in case a chain of mistakes and circumstances will lead to an explosion.
Wars on our planet are regular. It sad but year to year new conflicts arise and change the old ones. Some conflicts may come to the stage of a cold war like few decades ago. We can name a whole list of countries where the peace is not complete or where the entire country is constantly living under war pressure. And it is just a question of tyme when the conflict will explode.
The only thing we can do is to spread the word of peace all around the world. We need to stand against terrorism together as one. We need to learn from our experience and keep our heads cool every time when our hand wants to grab a gun. There are much more things to see and feel in this world. Peace is impossible but it is possible to keep it as long as we can.
